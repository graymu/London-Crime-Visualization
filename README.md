# London-Crime-Visualization
In this project I take a look at crime data in London from 2009 to 2016 and visualize some key aspects of four major crime categories in the city: Burglary, Criminal Damage, Drugs, and Violence Against the Person.

## Tools Used
+ Google's **BigQuery**, to pull the necessary publically-available data for my needs.
+ A brief detour in **Excel** to rearrange the queried data.
+ **RStudio**, to write and run the visualization code with the help of the **ggplot2** package.
